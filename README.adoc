= K9: Self-Validating Components
:toc: preamble
:toclevels: 2

A file format that "eats its own dog food."

== What is K9?

K9 is a Self-Validating Component (SVC) standard built on the **must-just-nickel** triad.
Unlike passive file formats that rely on external applications to interpret them, a `.k9` file
carries its own validation contracts and deployment logic.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A `.k9` file is not a document you open; it is a component you unleash.
====

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-svc.git
cd k9-svc

# Check environment
./must status

# Ensure dependencies (Nickel + Just)
./must ensure

# Register MIME type
./must run register-user

# Validate everything
./must run dogfood
----

== The Triad

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Layer |Component |Function

|**Must**
|Environment Shim
|Detects OS/architecture, ensures Nickel and Just are available

|**Just**
|Orchestration
|Task runner that executes build, validate, deploy recipes

|**Nickel**
|Validation Engine
|Typed configuration language that enforces contracts
|===

== Security Levels (The "Leash")

K9 implements tiered execution to prevent abuse:

[horizontal]
`'Kennel`:: Pure data. No execution. Safe to open anywhere.
`'Yard`:: Nickel evaluation only. No I/O side effects.
`'Hunt`:: Full triad execution. Requires cryptographic handshake.

== Security

K9 takes security seriously. Self-executing components require careful design and implementation.

**⚠️ Important:** K9 is under active security hardening. See our roadmap for production readiness timeline.

**For Users:**

* **Before using K9:** Read link:docs/SECURITY-BEST-PRACTICES.adoc[Security Best Practices]
* **Common questions:** See link:docs/SECURITY-FAQ.adoc[Security FAQ]
* **Report vulnerabilities:** See link:SECURITY.md[Security Policy]

**For Decision Makers:**

* **Executive summary:** link:docs/SECURITY-FOR-DECISION-MAKERS.adoc[Security for Decision Makers]
* **Implementation timeline:** link:docs/SECURITY-ROADMAP.adoc[Security Roadmap]
* **Technical analysis:** link:SECURITY-SOLUTIONS-VS-MITIGATIONS.adoc[Solutions vs Mitigations]

**Current Security Posture:**

- **Kennel/Yard components:** Production-ready (data-only, no execution risks)
- **Hunt components:** Development use only (requires Tier 1-3 hardening)
- **Target:** 95% risk elimination after Tier 1-3 implementation (6-12 months)

**Key Protections:**

* Ed25519 digital signatures for Hunt components
* Nickel contract validation at runtime
* Three-tier security model (Kennel/Yard/Hunt isolation)
* Planned: Rust rewrite, HSM key storage, mandatory sandboxing

== Philosophy

The "dogfooding" principle: **a format should be able to validate and deploy itself.**

Traditional formats separate data from logic. This creates:

- **Bit rot**: Data survives, but the tools to interpret it die
- **Platform lock-in**: Files only work with specific applications
- **Silent corruption**: Invalid data isn't detected until runtime failure

K9 solves this by embedding validation contracts (Nickel) and deployment
recipes (Just) directly in the component. If the file can't "eat its own
config," it refuses to run.
